## ü§ù Contributing
Want to update a reference page with new BOFs? Or write a new article? Or make changes?
- Open a pull request

- Include links, descriptions, and credit where due
- Or, submit an issue with whatever you would like to see changed

This repo thrives on contributions from both red and blue teams in the community. I hope we can apply the structure I have created to add new information as it appears. The entire project is written in markdown, making it easy for anyone to fork, modify and submit pull requests or issues.

*Note*: I have used AI to help me write and structure some the articles. I have reviewed all the information, but if mistakes have snuck in, its probably this human's fault, rather than AI slop. Again however, issues and pull requests are very welcome to correct any wrong information.

## About Di√°taxis
This project follow the approach of the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation framework. Di√°taxis identifies four distinct needs, and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. All articles in this repository if therefore organised around the structures of those needs. This ensures high-quality, easy to discover and use documentation.
